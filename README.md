This is my backend server I developed for my NBA Guessing Game (Draft Edition) application. I mainly use the Python NBA_API to access player stats and use that to create my flask server and subsequent API endpoints. In the future, I will look to implement better guessing mechanisms such as representing Teams with Conferences or Divisions to allow players to use that prompt more effectively as well as implement hints that a player may look at if they are stuck.

Here are the steps to run the server locally: 

* Starting virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate
* Download all required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt  
* Start server: python app.py
